A C# program is available that pulls source code file names from git and populates an XML file that can be used to define Checkpoints in SourceMonitor. The code is free.

Note from Jukka Jylänki:

Ok, I have now put up the C# code. It can be found here: https://github.com/juj/GitSourceMonitor
 
I also implemented an incremental update mechanism that the tool won't try to always recreate each commit as a new checkpoint from scratch, but instead checks the project file date to detect where to continue updating.
Thanks for the help on this, it made the effort quite fast and painless.
