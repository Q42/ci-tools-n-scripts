The file barchart.xsl was supplied by Jonas Larsson via the following email:

Hello,

First, thank you for a great tool! 

We've recently decided to use it in our CC-build process to visualize code complexity, and in the process of doing that I updated the barchart.xsl to create .svg's that works with firefox's svg implemantion.
I've attached my updates in this e-mail, if you'd like to use them.

Best Regards
   Jonas
